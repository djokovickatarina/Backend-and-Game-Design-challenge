The solution starts from the assumption that we get the data through console.Each club is one class that has its own name and rating that is calculated using each playerâ€™s rating and number of players. If user enter even number of clubs, pairs won't be created. The program runs as a java application and by entering input data through the console we get  pairs of clubs organized by their ratings.
